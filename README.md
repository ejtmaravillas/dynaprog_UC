# Dynamic Programming for Unit Commitment

## What is Unit Commitment?
The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is solved in this study using dynamic programming. Reducing the dimensionality of the unit commitment problem is one advantages of dynamic programming.
A 4-unit system was used in illustrating the dynamic programming algorithm. The optimal schedule of the generators and the minimum overall cost was successfully obtained. The overall cost includes both the production and start-up costs.
